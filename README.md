# Character recognizer

We use python, opencv, sklearn to recognize handwritten latin letters from K to T.

train.py run training with "/data/Sample*".

test.py run test images, which is in "data/test". As a result you'll get a named window (where first letter in name is prediction of model) per image in test.
